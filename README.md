# vim_config
My little, basic vim config, I like to sync it across all the computers I use. And I am addicted to git.

To use, simply pull down this repo and point your vim to use this config file.
If on Windows, I find it useful to hardlink the default config (_vimrc) to the .vimrc in this repository.
But really, there are lots of great vimrc examples out there. This isn't one of them.
